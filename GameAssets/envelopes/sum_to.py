# /-- Total correctness for `n ≥ 0`: `sum_to(n)` terminates and returns the
# `n`-th triangular number — in clause form (LoopTactic.lean). The loop
# counts *down*: the Python variable `n` is mutated, so the theorem binder
# `n` shadows it and the invariant must mention the initial value — hence
# `(state := [s, n])` (the escape hatch, exactly as in
# Examples/python/gcd/proof.lean), with lambda binders `s`/`k` for the running sum
# and the current countdown value. Invariant: `s` already holds the summed
# tail `(k+1) + ⋯ + n`, stated multiplication-free as
# `2*s = (n - k)*(n + k + 1)`, plus the range `0 ≤ k ≤ n`; the measure is
# `k` itself. Residual goals are pure arithmetic on named atoms: the exit
# algebra (first bullet: `hcont` and the range force `k' = 0`, then `grind`
# finishes the division), then invariant preservation, measure decrease,
# and the initial invariant, all closed by `grind`. No `Val`, no fuel, no
# AST anywhere. -/
